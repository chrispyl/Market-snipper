### Some details first

This was a university project for the course of "Software technology". The idea belongs to our professor Ioannis Athasiadis. 
It was a team project consisting of four members, the rest of the team were 
* Katerina Triantafullidi
* Charalambos Orfanoudakis
* Ioannis Kordonis
Each one had a role and i had done the programming part. During the course we used the Scrum methodology and made three sprints. The results of each sprint are mentioned in the corresponding files (in greek).

## Market snipper

An android app that helps to shop cheaper in the vicinity of Ksanthi. The user can scan the barcode of a product, enter its price and compare it to the price of other markets he had gone.
He can put his favourite products in a basket and check where it is cheaper to buy them together. There is also an indicator to show if a product price isn't available for a market. The distance 
of each market from the current position of the user is provided in order to help him decide. Three 
markets where included (and the caffe of the university).
